## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I probably wait too long. I like to figure things out. For example, I've been working on building a nutrition calculator using vanilla javascript and html / css and I've spend hours and hours trying to solve various problems.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

````
puts "Hello World!"
````

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

````
# now I can write my comment
````

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

Integer = a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with decimal points (even if it's 0 - e.g 1.0).

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

````
animal = 'zebra'
````

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

````
puts animal
````

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

````
interpolation = interjecting something new
animal = "Fenrir"
puts "My dog's name is #{animal}!"
````

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

````
gets.chomp
````

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

1. .split = used to break apart a string into an array (a collection of items). You can use the generic .split and it will break at every space. Or, you can define what character will lead to a new array item.

2. .length = tells you the length (number of characters) in your string.
